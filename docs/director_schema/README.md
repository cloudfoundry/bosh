# BOSH Director Database Schema

Here is an ER diagram of the schema that the BOSH director uses for
storing its state. The schema is accessed through a Ruby ORM called
Sequel. The Ruby classes that this schema maps to are located in the
[director's Models module](../../bosh-director/lib/bosh/director/models).
