BOSH Acceptance Tests
=====================

The BOSH Acceptance Tests are meant to be used to verify the commonly used functionality of BOSH.

It requires a BOSH deployment, either a deployed micro bosh stemcell, or a full bosh-release deployment.

Note! If you don't run BAT via the rake tasks, it is up to you to make sure the environment is setup correctly.

Before you can run BAT, you need to set the following environment variables:
* BAT_DIRECTOR
  DNS name or IP address of the bosh director used for testing
* BAT_STEMCELL
  path to the stemcell you want to use for testing
* BAT_DEPLOYMENT_SPEC
  path to the bat yaml file which is used to generate the deployment manifest
  (see bat/templates)
* BAT_RELEASE_DIR
  path to the bat release repository
* BAT_VCAP_PASSWORD
  password used to ssh to the stemcells

If BAT_FAST is set, the stemcell & release will not be deleted between each spec. This speeds up testing considerably!

When all of the above is ready, you can run:
rake bat
which will run the whole test suite.

TODO
* add rake task to download stemcell & bat-release (for full automation)
