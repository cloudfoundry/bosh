BOSH Acceptance Tests
=====================

Note! If you don't run BAT via the rake tasks, it is up to you to make sure the environment is setup correctly.

Before you can run BAT, you need to set the following environment variables:
* BAT_DIRECTOR
  DNS name or IP address of the bosh director
* BAT_STEMCELL
  path to the stemcell you want to use for testing
* BAT_DEPLOYMENT
  path to the bat deployment manifest
* BAT_RELEASE_DIR
  path to the bat release repository

When all of the above is ready, you can run:
rake bat
which will run the whole test suite.

TODO
* method generate different deployments manifests
  should only need network info as input
* tag fast tests
  and add rake task to run them
* add rake task to download stemcell & bat-release
