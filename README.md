# BOSH [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/bosh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/bosh) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/cloudfoundry/bosh.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/cloudfoundry/bosh)

Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering,
deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services.

Our documentation is available at [docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh).

## Installing BOSH gems

To install the latest bosh CLI gems:

```
gem install bosh_cli

# Plugin required for deploying MicroBosh
gem install bosh_cli_plugin_micro

# Plugin required for 'bosh aws create' and bootstrap commands
gem install bosh_cli_plugin_aws
```

## Using BOSH CLI and plugins from Git

```
bundle install --binstubs
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH
which bosh
```

The `bosh` CLI is now in your `$PATH`, including the `bosh micro` plugin from the git source, rather than any rubygems you have installed.
