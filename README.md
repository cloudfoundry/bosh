Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services. In this manual we describe the architecture, topology, configuration, and use of BOSH, as well as the structure and conventions used in packaging and deployment.

* BOSH Documentation: [http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/deploying-cf/](http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/deploying-cf/)

## Building and Installing BOSH gems from source

Sometimes it's helpful to have the latest BOSH gems before they are published to RubyGems. Here is an example how to build the latest from source. The gem builds require ruby 1.9.3-p327 currently, which you can see in the .ruby-version file. This example works on OSX.

    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh.git 
	cd bosh
	for i in bosh_common  blobstore_client bosh_cli ; do cd $i ; gem build *.gemspec  ; GEM=$(ls -1rt| tail -1 ) ; gem install $GEM; cd -; done
