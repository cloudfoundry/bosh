# BOSH

Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool chain for release engineering, deployment and lifecycle management of large scale distributed services. In this manual we describe the architecture, topology, configuration, and use of BOSH, as well as the structure and conventions used in packaging and deployment.

## OSS Contributions

The Cloud Foundry team uses Gerrit, a code review tool that originated in the Android Open Source Project. We also use GitHub as an official mirror, though all pull requests are accepted via Gerrit.

Follow these steps to make a contribution to any of our open source repositories:

1. Complete our CLA Agreement for [individuials](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/individualcontribution.pdf) or [corporations](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/corpcontribution.pdf)
1. Sign up for an account on our public Gerrit server at http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org/
1. Create and upload your public SSH key in your Gerrit account profile
1. Set your name and email

		git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
		git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

Install our gerrit-cli gem:

		gem install gerrit-cli

Clone the Cloud Foundry repo

_Note: to clone the BOSH repo, or the Documentation repo, replace `vcap` with `bosh` or `oss-docs`_

		gerrit clone ssh://reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/vcap
		cd vcap

Make your changes, commit, and push to gerrit:

		git commit
		gerrit push

Once your commits are approved by our Continuous Integration Bot (CI Bot) as well as our engineering staff, return to the Gerrit interface and MERGE your changes. The merge will be replicated to GitHub automatically at [http://github.com/cloudfoundry/](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/). If you get feedback on your submission, we recommend squashing your commit with the original change-id. See the squashing section here for more details: [http://help.github.com/rebase/](http://help.github.com/rebase/).

After the CI Bot successfully tests your change, you need to ask some Reviewers to accept your commit.

Within each sub-project of BOSH are the authorized "+2" reviewers:

* agent - Skaar
* cli - Oleg
* director - Oleg, Vadim
* deployer - Doug, Martin
* blobstore_client - Martin
* vsphere_cpi - Vadim
* aws_cpi - Oleg, Martin
* aws_registry - Oleg, Martin
* health_monitor - Oleg
* package_compiler - Martin
* openstack - Ferran, Vadim

Once your commit has been given a "+2" by one of the reviewers above, you can then merge your commit in via Gerrit dashboard.

Finally, your contribution will be available via the gerrit and github git repositories.
