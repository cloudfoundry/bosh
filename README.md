# BOSH

Cloud Foundry BOSH is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.

This repository is a Bosh Release, providing the necessary binaries and
configuration templates for deploying a new Bosh Director instance, as
instructed by some Bosh deployment manifest, to be applied by some Bosh CLI
invocation or a pre-existing Bosh Director instance.

## Quick start

Bosh is deployed by Bosh, and in order to bootstrap a new Bosh server from
scratch, the Bosh CLI acts as a lightweight Bosh server with the
`bosh create-env` command. Please refer to this
[Quick Start installation guide](https://bosh.io/docs/quick-start/) for more
details.
