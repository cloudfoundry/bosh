  # CPI - Cloud Provider Interface, used for interfacing with various IaaS APIs.
  #
  # Key terms:
  # Stemcell: template used for creating VMs (shouldn't be powered on)
  # VM:       VM created from a stemcell with custom settings (networking and resources)
  # Disk:     volume that can be attached and detached from the VMs,
  #           never attached to more than a single VM at one time
