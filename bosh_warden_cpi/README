# BOSH Warden Cloud Provider

# Running with Vagrant up

First things first: if you find that the "chef/cookbooks" directory is not present, do

  cd chef
  librarian-chef install


Later on, after the vagrant box is set up and the director + Warden is successfully running,
you'll probably have to download a stemcell from s3 and then upload it to the director.

we need a warden-friendly stemcell that includes the director. micro_bosh stemcell did not work. Let's try vsphere next

No worries, we'll soon work this into the vagrantfile
