  # CPI - Cloud Provider Interface, used for interfacing with various IaaS APIs.
  #
  # Key terms:
  # Stemcell:: template used for creating VMs (shouldn't be powered on)
  # VM::       VM created from a stemcell with custom settings (networking and resources)
  # Disk::     volume that can be attached and detached from the VMs,
  #            never attached to more than a single VM at one time

    # Creates a VM - creates (and powers on) a VM from a stemcell with the proper resources
    # and on the specified network. When disk locality is present the VM will be placed near
    # the provided disk so it won't have to move when the disk is attached later.
