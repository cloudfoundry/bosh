  class EventLog

    # Event log conventions:
    # All event log entries having same "stage" logically belong to the same event group.
    # "tags" is an array of strings that supposed to act as hint of what is being tracked.
    # Each "<stage name> <tags>" combination represents a number of steps that is tracked
    # separately.
    # "task" is just a description of current step that acts as a hint for event log renderer,
    # i.e. it can be displayed next to progress bar.
    # Example: "job_update" stage might have two tasks: "canary update" and "update"
    # and a separate tag for each job name, so each job will have a separate progress
    # bar in CLI.

    # Sample rendering for event log entry:
    # {"time":1312233461,"stage":"job_update","task":"update","tags":["mysql_node"],"index":2,"total":4,"state":"finished"}

    # Job update (mysql_node):
    # update |--------        | (2/4) 50%
