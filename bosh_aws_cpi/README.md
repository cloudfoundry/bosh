## Options

These options are passed to the AWS CPI when it is instantiated.

### AWS options

* `access_key_id` (required)
  AWS IAM user access key
* `secret_access_key` (required)
  AWS IAM secret access key
* `default_key_name` (required)
  default AWS ssh key name to assign to created virtual machines
* `default_security_groups` (required)
  list of AWS security group to assign to created virtual machines
* `ec2_private_key` (required)
  local path to the ssh private key, must match `default_key_name`
* `region` (required)
  EC2 region
* `ec2_endpoint` (optional)
  URL of the EC2 endpoint to connect to, defaults to the endpoint corresponding to the selected region,
  or `default_ec2_endpoint` if no region has been selected
* `elb_endpoint` (optional)
  URL of the ELB endpoint to connect to, default to the endpoint corresponding to the selected region,
  or `default_elb_endpoint` if no region has been selected
* `max_retries` (optional)
  maximum number of time to retry an AWS API call, defaults to `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES`

### Registry options

The registry options are passed to the AWS CPI by the BOSH director based on the settings in `director.yml`, but can be
overridden if needed.

* `endpoint` (required)
  registry URL
* `user` (required)
  registry user
* `password` (required)
  registry password

### Agent options

Agent options are passed to the AWS CPI by the BOSH director based on the settings in `director.yml`, but can be
overridden if needed.

### Resource pool options

These options are specified under `cloud_options` in the `resource_pools` section of a BOSH deployment manifest.

* `availability_zone` (optional)
  the EC2 availability zone the VMs should be created in
* `instance_type` (required)
  which [type of instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) the VMs should belong to
* `spot_bid_price` (optional)
  the [AWS spot instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/) bid price to use.  When specified spot instances are started rather than on demand instances.  _NB: this will dramatically slow down resource pool creation._

### Network options

These options are specified under `cloud_options` in the `networks` section of a BOSH deployment manifest.

* `type` (required)
  can be either `dynamic` for a DHCP assigned IP by AWS, or `vip` to use an Elastic IP (which needs to be already
  allocated)

## Example

This is a sample of how AWS specific properties are used in a BOSH deployment manifest:

    ---
    name: sample
    director_uuid: 38ce80c3-e9e9-4aac-ba61-97c676631b91

    ...

    networks:
      - name: nginx_network
        type: vip
        cloud_properties: {}
      - name: default
        type: dynamic
        cloud_properties:
          security_groups:
          - default

    ...

    resource_pools:
      - name: common
        network: default
        size: 3
        stemcell:
          name: bosh-aws-xen-ubuntu
          version: latest
        cloud_properties:
          instance_type: m1.small

    ...

    properties:
      aws:
        access_key_id: AKIAIYJWVDUP4KRWBESQ
        secret_access_key: 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
        default_key_name: bosh
        default_security_groups: ["bosh"]
        ec2_private_key: /home/bosh/.ssh/bosh
