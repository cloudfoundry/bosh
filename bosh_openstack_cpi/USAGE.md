## Options

These options are passed to the OpenStack CPI when it is instantiated.

### OpenStack options

The registry options are passed to the Openstack CPI by the BOSH director based on the settings in `director.yml`:

* `auth_url` (required)
  URL of the OpenStack Identity endpoint to connect to
* `username` (required)
  OpenStack user name
* `api_key` (required)
  OpenStack API key
* `tenant` (required)
  OpenStack tenant name
* `region` (optional)
  OpenStack region
* `endpoint_type` (optional)
  OpenStack endpoint type (publicURL (default), adminURL, internalURL)
* `stemcell_public_visibility` (optional)
  Set public visibility for stemcells (true or false (default))
* `default_key_name` (required)
  default OpenStack ssh key name to assign to created virtual machines
* `default_security_group` (required)
  default OpenStack security group to assign to created virtual machines

### Registry options

The registry options are passed to the Openstack CPI by the BOSH director based on the settings in `director.yml`:

* `endpoint` (required)
  OpenStack registry URL
* `user` (required)
  OpenStack registry user
* `password` (required)
  OpenStack registry password

### Agent options

The agent options are passed to the OpenStack CPI by the BOSH director based on the settings in `director.yml`:

## Network options

The OpenStack CPI supports these networks types:

* `type` (required)
  can be `dynamic` for a DHCP assigned IP by OpenStack, `manual` for a static IP assigned manually at the BOSH deployment manifest or `vip` to use a Floating IP (which needs to be already allocated)

These options are specified under `cloud_properties` in the `networks` section of a BOSH deployment manifest:

* `security_groups` (optional)
  the OpenStack security groups to assign to VMs. If not specified, it'll use the default security groups set at the OpenStack options

* `net_id` (required for `manual` networks)
  the OpenStack Quantum network UUID to attach as a NIC to VMs.

## Resource pool options

These options are specified under `cloud_properties` in the `resource_pools` section of a BOSH deployment manifest:

* `instance_type` (required)
  which type of instance (OpenStack flavor) the VMs should belong to
* `availability_zone` (optional)
  the OpenStack availability zone the VMs should be created in

## Example

This is a sample of how OpenStack specific properties are used in a BOSH deployment manifest:
