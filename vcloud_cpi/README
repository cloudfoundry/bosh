BOSH vCloud Cloud Provider

A BOSH CPI implementation for a vCloud Director backed infrastructure cloud.

Use the vSphere MICRO BOSH and BOSH stemcells when targetting vCloud Director.

In order to target a vCloud Director instance, BOSH must be set to use
the vCloud plugin configuration as shown below.  Follow the same process
as when targetting vSphere but replacing the cloud plugin configuration.
