# This task can be used to test the template rendering for a bosh release. It performs a "--dry-run" bosh deployment
# so no jobs will actually be run. The bosh director used within the docker image is rebuilt after each release
# of the bosh director.

# This task must be run as a privileged container.

# The bosh director repository is a required input, as is your release. You may specify an additional "manifests" input
# for the manifests to deploy or you can use manifests within your release repository. The MANIFESTS_FOLDER param should
# point to the relative path of your manifests: i.e. "release/tests/manifests"

# If DEV_RELEASE is set to "true" the task will create a dev release and upload that. Otherwise it will simply run
# "bosh upload-release" which will upload the most recent final release.

# The test manifests do not need to be complete valid deployment manifests, the task will fill in the infrastructure
# details such as stemcell, vm_types, networks, azs and the update section. They will need to include a single instance
# group that includes any jobs you want to render templates for.

# Variables can be defined and referenced from the job properties if needed.
